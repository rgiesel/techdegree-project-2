# techdegree-project-2

This project takes an already compiled list of students and displays 10 student
profiles per page. The script creates and appends the necessary HTML elements,
including pagination links for viewing the students. As an added feature,
users can search the list of students via a search input field and button, which
return paginated results. If no students match the search parameters, a message
is displayed on the page.
